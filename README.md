## Content 

This project is a simple anagram game that uses Flask in the backend for server-side logic and AJAX in the frontend for user interface. 

## Function

This simple anagram game involves a list of basic words and an anagram that consists of randomly chosen jumbled words. Users are able to enter words into the textbox that can be created from the jumble of words. When a matching word is entered, it is added to a list of found words. If its not, it will prompt `Word is not in the list`. If the user types a word that's already in the list of found words, it will prompt `Word already found`.
Users that match three words will be redirected to a page that says `This is awesome` with an option to play again.
